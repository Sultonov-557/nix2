# 🙌 How to Contribute

Nixul is a community-driven project, and we'd love your help to make it even better. Whether you're a Nix wizard or a design enthusiast, there are plenty of ways to contribute.

## Ways to Contribute

*   **Create a Flavor:** The most obvious way to contribute is to create and submit your own Flavor. Check out our [guide to creating a Flavor](./creating-a-flavor.md) to get started.
*   **Report Bugs:** If you find a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/your-username/nixul/issues). Be as descriptive as possible, and include steps to reproduce the issue.
*   **Suggest Features:** Have an idea for a new feature? We'd love to hear it. [Open an issue](https://github.com/your-username/nixul/issues) and tell us about it.
*   **Improve the Documentation:** Good documentation is key. If you see something that's unclear or could be improved, feel free to open a Pull Request.
*   **Fix Bugs:** Check out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/your-username/nixul/issues) for bugs that need fixing.

## Submitting Changes

When you're ready to submit a change, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Create a new branch** for your changes.
3.  **Make your changes.**
4.  **Test your changes** to make sure they don't break anything.
5.  **Commit your changes** using our semantic commit style (see below).
6.  **Open a Pull Request.**

## Semantic Commit Style

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to keep our commit history clean and readable. It also helps us automate releases.

The format is:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

*   **type:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
*   **scope (optional):** The part of the codebase you're changing (e.g., `flavor-catppuccin`, `docs`, `flake`).
*   **subject:** A short, descriptive summary of the change.

**Examples:**

*   `feat(flavor-dracula): add new dracula flavor`
*   `fix(hyprland): correct keybind for rofi`
*   `docs(readme): add more badges`
*   `chore: update nixpkgs flake input`

Using this format makes it easy to see what's changed at a glance.

## Code of Conduct

We want Nixul to be a welcoming and inclusive community. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/your-username/nixul/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (I'll need to add a Code of Conduct file).

Thanks for helping us build the future of NixOS!
